  About Paid Family and Medical Leave in Massachusetts
subquestion: |
  Paid family and medical leave (PFML) is a program designed to help people in Massachusetts take paid time off of work for family or medical reasons. As soon as you notify your employer that you are applying to take paid family or medical leave, certain protections begin. 

  Generally, an employee who has taken paid family or medical leave must be restored to the employee’s previous position or to an equal position, with the same status, pay, employment benefits, length-of-service credit, and seniority as of the date of leave.

  This form will help you determine:
  
  * If you are a {covered individual}
  * If the reason for leave offers job protections
  * If your employer may have violated your rights under Massachusetts law

terms:
  covered individual: |
    Generally, a worker qualifies as a covered individual eligible for paid family and medical leave benefits if the worker is covered by unemployment insurance in Massachusetts and paid wages by a Massachusetts employer.
